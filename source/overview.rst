Overview
========

Unlike mouse, pig, and opossum --from whom reference genomes are readily available, bat's transcriptome had to be inferred from our RNA-seq data. This forked the analyzes into one branch that is specific for bat, and another branch that is common for the remaining species. The second and third chapters present the gene expression analysis using the *de novo* transcriptome (bat), and available reference genomes (mouse, pig, and opossum), respectively. All results are then joined at the final chapter, where differential expression analysis are done between the four species.

Updates
-------

Jan 26, 2014:
   * Added new opossum (27FL)  and pig (20, 22, and 26 on FL and HL) libraries on the analyzes. The cleaned fastq, aligment and gene expression files were added to: :ref:`mousePigOpossum`. The between species analyzes were updated. The results using all data are presented in the section: :ref:`betweenSpeciesNewData`
