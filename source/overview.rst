Overview
========

Here, we studied the genetic expression profiles underlying limb developmental processes. We have sequenced RNA-seq libraries at three developmental stages (ridge, bud, and paddle) on the fore and hind-limbs of four species (bat, pig, mouse, and opossum). 

Unlike mouse, pig, and opossum --from whom reference genomes are readily available, bat's transcriptome had to be inferred from our RNA-seq data. This forked the gene expression and differential expression analyzes into one branch that is specific for bat,

:ref:`bat`

and another that is common for the remaining species. 

:ref:`mousePigOpossum` 

The second and third chapters present the gene expression analysis using the *de novo* transcriptome (bat), and available reference genomes (mouse, pig, and opossum), respectively. 

All previous results are then joined to study differential gene expression across the four species.

:ref:`betweenSpecies`

This section was updated to reflect the addition of novel libraries on opossum and mouse. The updated results can be found at:

:ref:`betweenSpeciesNewData`

Finally, a study about how species-specific are the transcriptomes of fore and hind-limbs across development is presented on:

:ref:`transcriptomeSpecificity`

Updates
-------

Jan 26, 2015:
   * Added new opossum (27FL)  and pig (20, 22, and 26 on FL and HL) libraries on the analyzes. The cleaned fastq, aligment and gene expression files were added to: :ref:`mousePigOpossum`. Two new sections were added: :ref:`betweenSpeciesNewData` and :ref:`transcriptomeSpecificiy`. The first is an update of the conservation of orthologs genes across-species, the second a new analysis of the transcriptome specificity of each species across developmental stages.
